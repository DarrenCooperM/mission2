URL only works with AUDI & MERCEDES-BENZ so far. In order to make other cars work, I would create a custom vision ai via https://www.customvision.ai and go from there.

Alternatively, I could access the information of the URL to focus on car type rather than car brand however, using the computer vision AI had its limitations and this was one of them.
